Kittiwake Populations Analysis
This repository contains the R code and supporting materials for an in-depth study of kittiwake populations. The research combines observational, historical, measurement, and location data to provide insights into these seabirds, with a focus on the black-legged and red-legged kittiwakes.

Project Overview
The study leverages multiple datasets to analyze:
	1	Observation Data: Examining daily behaviors and sighting patterns across different times of the day.
	2	Historical Data: Trends in breeding pairs at various sites over time.
	3	Measurement Data: Physical characteristics (weight, wingspan, culmen length) of the two subspecies.
	4	Location Data: Environmental factors affecting breeding pair distribution using linear regression models.

Key Findings
	•	Observation data shows peak kittiwake sightings at dusk.
	•	Historical data reveals site-specific factors in population decline.
	•	Measurement data highlights significant differences in wingspan and culmen length between subspecies.
	•	Location data identifies sandeel concentration and cliff height as critical ecological factors.
